					UNION IN DBMS
==================================================================================================================
9) UNION :- UNION Clouse used to combine the result-set of two or more select query 

        Applying union between single column
        The columns used in all the select statements must have the following
	i) The Same number of columns
	ii) Similar or compatible data types 
	iii) Same logical order
        
	Selecting more than one column in the select query

	"Whenever more than one column is specified in the select clause then the combination of all columns
	considered that is if both values in the row are same then only this considered as a duplicate value"


	Select city from sample1 
	union
	Select city from sample2

	Select city, country from sample1 
	union
	Select city, country from sample2

	UNION ALL :- UNION Remove duplicate values while comparing where UNION ALL allows duplicate values while 
		     combining
	
	Select city from sample1 
	union all
	Select city from sample2
==================================================================================================================
10) What is INNER JOIN ?
	what is dose - 

	- Based on the equality condition data is retrieved from the multiple tables
	- We must have a common column in the both the tables with the same data types 
	- Right table row is joined with left table row only if there is a matching for the left table row
	  In right table 

	  SQL :- SELECT ENAME, SAL, DEPT.DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC
		 FROM EMP, DEPT
	  	 WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;

	  NO OF ROWS IN RESULT SET OF INNER JOIN
	  
	  SQL :- SELECT ENAME, SAL, D.DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC
		 FROM EMP E, DEPT D
	  	 WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO;

	1) Display employee whose are working in location CHICAGO from emp and dept table ?

	SQL :- SELECT ENAME, SAL, D.DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC
		FROM EMP E, DEPT D
		WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND LOC 'CHICAGO';

	2) Display the department name and total salaries from each department
	
	SQL :- SELECT DNAME, SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E, DEPT D
		WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
		GROUP BY DNAME;

11) what is SELF JOIN ?
	what it does 
	 - Join a table itself is called self join
	 - Comparing values of a values with the values of same column itself or different column values 
	 	of same table 

	1)  Display employee details who are getting more salary than their manager salary
		
		SQL :- SELECT E1.ENAME "EMPLOYES", E2.ENAME "MANAGER", E2.SAL
			FROM EMP E1, EMP E2
			WHERE E2.EMPNO=E1.MGR AND E1.SAL>E2.SAL;
	
	2) Display the employee details who joined before their manager ?
		
		SQL :- SELECT E1.ENAME "EMPLOYES", E2.ENAME "MANAGER", E2.SAL, E2.HIREDATE
			FROM EMP E1, EMP E2
			WHERE E1.MGR=E2.EMPNO AND E1.HIREDATE<E2.HIREDATE;

12) what is left join ?
	:- All rows from the left side table.
	:- Matching value row from the right side table 
	:- Null values in place of non matching row in other table

	SQL :- SELECT ROWNUM, EMPNO, ENAME, DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC ,JOB
		FROM EMP
		LEFT JOIN
		DEPT
		ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO AND DNAME = ''SALES';

13) what is Right JOIN ?

	:- All rows from right side table are displayed 
	:- Matching values rows from left side table 
	:- Null values in place of non matching row in other table

	SQL :- SELECT ENAME, JOB, SAL, LOC, DNAME, DEPT.DEPTNO FROM EMP
		RIGHT JOIN
		DEPT
		ON DEPT.DEPTNO = EMP.DEPTNO AND DEPT.DETPNO = 20; with condition

14) What is FULL JOIN ?
	
	mechanisum
	:- A full join in viewed as a result of union operation of an inner join , left join and right join
	:- It returns all matched record i.e where the join condition is satisfied on both tables
	:- It returns all row from the right side table (Unmatched right side rows).
	:- It returns all row from the left side table (unmatched left side rows).
	:- this join returns null values in place of nonmatching tuples in other table.

	SQL :- SELECT ENAME, SAL, D.DEPTNO,E.DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP
		FULL JOIN
		DEPT D
		ON D.DEPTNO = 20;

15) What is Cross JOIN ?
	
16)
